# Basic Keylogger (Educational Use Only)

A simple Python keylogger that records keystrokes into a local text file.

## How It Works

- Captures all typed characters.
- Logs them into a file called `keylog.txt`.
- Stops when the script is manually terminated (Ctrl+C or ESC depending on listener).

## Requirements

Install `pynput`:

```bash
pip install pynput
